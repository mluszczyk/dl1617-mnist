DL1617 MNIST
============

This is a solution to the MNIST exercise for Deep Neural Networks course.

The code was checked on:
- Python 3.6
- tensorflow 1.1.0 (consult requirements.txt)
- pip 9.0.1, setuptools 35.0.2 (should there be any problems with installing requirements)

Three scripts are included:
- train.py (part I of the exercise) - trains the model.
- digits.py (part II of the exercise) - for each digit, tries to find an image that maximizes digit's probability.
- check.py - returns model's result when given output of digits.py (sanity check).
